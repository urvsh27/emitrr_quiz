2. It is fully dynamic, excluding some stuffs that can not be done from frontend.
3. User can login and register thorogh it's relavant pages.

6. Admin can view the languages which are active. Languages arw coming from server.
7. Each languages can have multiple exercises.
8. Exercise has the questions, weightage, totalMarks.
9. Admin can add, update, delete, activate, deactivate the exercises.
10. Once admin add the exercise by default it will be set to deactivate. 
11. Only after adding the questions to that particular exercise and adding the weightage admin can activate the exercise.
12. If the exercise is active it will show to the user dashboard.
13. Coming to the user dashboard, user can manage the language preference.
